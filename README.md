# MatchCore
MatchCore is a backend-driven, high-performance job recommendation engine built to simulate how modern platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed match candidates with jobs — but with a strong focus on data structures, optimization, and system design.  The system ingests large datasets (e.g., 100K+ jobs, 10K+ candidates) and computes top job recommendations
# DataBase
